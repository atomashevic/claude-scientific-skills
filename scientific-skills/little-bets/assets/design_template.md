## Core Question

[Single, clear question this experiment will answer]

> Example: "Does network topology significantly affect opinion convergence time?"

---

## Hypothesis

If **[condition/intervention]**, then **[expected outcome]**, because **[reasoning/mechanism]**.

> Example: "If we use scale-free networks instead of random networks, then opinion convergence will be slower, because hubs create echo chambers that resist consensus."

## Minimal Experiment

### Data

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Type | [synthetic / real / proxy / existing benchmark] |
| Size | [N samples/nodes/documents] |
| Source | [how to obtain or generate] |
| Preprocessing | [minimal steps needed] |

**Data Generation Code** (if synthetic):
```python
# Quick description of data generation
# Keep this < 20 lines
```

### Method

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Approach | [brief description of method] |
| Tools | [libraries/packages to use] |
| Simplifications | [what we're skipping for now] |
| Complexity | [O(?) or "runs in < X minutes"] |

**Implementation Notes**:
- 
- 

### Success Criteria

| Level | Criterion | Threshold |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 🔴 Failure | [What would indicate this doesn't work] | [specific value] |
| 🟡 Minimum | [Threshold to continue investing] | [specific value] |
| 🟢 Exciting | [Threshold indicating breakthrough] | [specific value] |
