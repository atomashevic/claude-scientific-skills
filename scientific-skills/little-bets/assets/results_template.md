## Summary

[2-3 sentences describing what was tried and what happened. Write this for your future self who has forgotten the details.]

> Example: "Tested whether network topology affects opinion convergence using 3 synthetic graph types (Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, Barabasi-Albert) with 50 nodes each. Found that scale-free networks converge 2-3x slower than random networks, with hub nodes acting as bottlenecks. Effect is robust across 10 random seeds."

## Key Finding

**[One clear, memorable takeaway from this experiment]**

> Example: "Network hubs slow down opinion convergence—they're too influential to easily update."
